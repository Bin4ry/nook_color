nook_color: Support files for nook_color development 

About
-----

The Nook Color is an OMAP3621 based 7" tablet produced by Barnes and Noble as an lcd-based e-Reader. At the same time, it serves as quite a handy target for MeeGo due to the similar SoC. 

A patch by Oleg Drokin that adds board file, serial console, gpio keys, MMC/SDCard and USB (peripheral) support has been accepted upstream. So Nook Color support is now available in the linux-omap-2.6 git tree and will be eventually pushed to linux-2.6. 

Since the Linux kernel can be compiled for dozens of different processor architectures and sub-architectures, there are config files that includes the compilation options that differ from the default settings listed in the kconfig files.

This project includes the defconfig file (provided by Oleg Drokin) for the Nook Color (Encore arch) and also other support files needed for its kernel development
